Hereâ€™s a crisp checklist of what a 4-year Java/Spring developer should know for a production-grade HFT system, prioritized for your project:

1. Load Balancing (Critical for HFT)
Spring Cloud Gateway

Route orders to multiple service instances.

Use @LoadBalanced with service discovery (Eureka/Nacos).

Kafka Partitioning

Distribute order matching workload across partitions by symbol.

2. Resilience
Circuit Breakers (Resilience4j)

java
Copy
@CircuitBreaker(name="orderService", fallbackMethod="fallback")
public Order placeOrder(Order order) { ... }
Rate Limiting
Prevent abuse with @RateLimiter.

3. Performance
Caching (Redis)
Cache hot order books (@Cacheable).

Async Processing
Use @Async for non-critical paths (e.g., audit logs).

4. Observability
Metrics (Prometheus)
Track order.latency, matching.rate.

Distributed Tracing (Zipkin)
Trace orders across services.

5. Event-Driven
Kafka
Publish OrderPlacedEvent for downstream processing.

6. Security
OAuth2
Secure APIs with JWT.

Rate Limiting
Block abusive clients.

7. Deployment
Kubernetes
Auto-scale order matching pods.

CI/CD
Zero-downtime deployments.

Next Steps to Implement Now
Add Spring Cloud Gateway for load balancing.

Integrate Kafka for event-driven matching.

Cache OrderBook in Redis.

Each can be done in <1 day. Let me know which one to tackle first! ðŸš€
